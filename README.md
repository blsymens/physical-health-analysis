# Physical health analysis
##### _Hello world:_ This is my first repository in Git. I set this up mainly for learning how to work with Git and try out some `coding` with Python.
**Goal:** Importing, preprocessing, analysing, and reporting physical data to assess human health condition.
I am still not sure where this is going to... But will see what it will become. Feel free to comment, or add masterpieces of code. 

Cheers!
